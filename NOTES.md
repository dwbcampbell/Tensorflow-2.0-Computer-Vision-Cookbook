# Notes

## Purpose
I am using this branch to work through the examples for the Tensorflow Computer Vision Cookbook.

I will create Jupyter workbooks for selected files and annotate them (with comments from Github Copilot).

And I will keep track of my discoveries in this file, but there is also  CHANGELOG.md
